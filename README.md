Evaluation Report:

From the strategy returns, we see an overall decrease in returns from 2016 on with a slight peak around 2020, a significant dip, then another slight peak mid 2020. We can see this in the plot below.

From the first model studying the actual versus strategy returns, we see that up until around 2019, the actual returns and strategy returns follow each other pretty much 1 to 1. From 2019 on, there is a slight divergence, however the trends remain fairly close for both lines.

From the logistic regression model, we see a bit more divergence between actual returns versus strategy returns. At 2018, we see the actual returns slightly peak as the strategy returns dip. These lines further diverge after 2019 with similar trends. However the strategy returns peak before the upward trend of the actual returns plot.
